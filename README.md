# Sales painel

The file prototype.cpp has the following implementation:

* you can add sale items
* the seller name must one of the following ones: Marcos A., Bianca G., Thomaz K., Denis W. or Daniel F.
* if the seller name is not in the list above, then you have to enter the seller name again
* when the item is added, it will list all the items sorted by sellers with the highest to lowest amount sold

Execute prototype.exe in order to run the program. In the command line, type:
``./prototype``

If you can't execute the program, you might try to compile it by typing: ``g++ -std=c++11 prototype.cpp -o prototype``
